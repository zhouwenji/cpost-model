# 1. Overview

The China POwer System Transition (CPOST) model is an energy system optimization model for China’s electric power system transition. It has been co-developed and maintained by Prof. Zhou Wenji’s group at the School of Applied Economics, Renmin University of China, and Prof. Ren Hongtao at the School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology. 

The model has an hourly temporal resolution (8760 hours in a typical year) and a geospatial resolution that covers 31 provinces belonging to 7 grid regions. CPOST employs a generalized structure that supports multiple nodes and energy carriers. The model’s core objective is to minimize total system costs under operational and engineering constraints in the electric power system. Key cost components include capital investments, fixed and variable operational costs, fuel costs, and emission penalties; constraints are set for energy balance, capacity, storage dynamics, and transmission flows; these together offer a detailed representation of power system operations and planning. The model is calibrated to reflect China’s generation technologies, storage, regional grids, and extensive transmission infrastructure. It provides a comprehensive and flexible framework for analyzing technical and economic outcomes of various power sector transition pathways.
